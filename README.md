# Jetboost Snippets
Welcome to our repository of utility code snippets that you can use to extend functionality that may not yet be offered as a first class citizen (natively) in Jetboost. Some of these features will eventually be built into Jetboost, but for now you can utilize these code snippets. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact our support team at [support@jetboost.io](mailto:support@jetboost.io).

### All Code Snippets
1. [Share Favorites List](./share-favorites-list.md)

3. [Run Code After Collection List Updates](./jetboostlistupdated.md)
4. [Scroll To Top After Pagination](./scroll-to-top.md)
